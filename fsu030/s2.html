                <h3>
                    Electromagnetic Waves (EM Waves)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We studied Energy, a measure of the ability to do work, comes in many forms and can transform from
                    one type to
                    another. An example of
                    stored or potential energy include batteries and water behind a dam and Objects in motion are
                    examples
                    of kinetic energy.

                    Charged particles—such as electrons and protons—create electromagnetic fields when they move, and
                    these fields transport
                    the type of energy which we call an electromagnetic radiation, or light. Electromagnetic radiations
                    are composed of electromagnetic waves that are produced when an
                    electric field comes in
                    contact with the magnetic field. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and
                    vice-versa—the two are linked.
                    These changing fields
                    form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not
                    require a medium to
                    propagate.

                    Electromagnetic waves were first postulated by James Clerk Maxwell and subsequently confirmed by
                    Heinrich Hertz.
                    Electromagnetic waves are created as a result of vibrations between an electric and
                    a magnetic
                    field. It can also be said that electromagnetic waves are the composition
                    of oscillating
                    electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves are solutions of Maxwell's equations, which are
                    the fundamental
                    equations of electrodynamics.

                <h3>
                    How EM waves are formed.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Electromagnetic waves are formed when an electric field comes in contact with a magnetic field. They
                    are hence known as
                    'electromagnetic' waves. The electric field and magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave are
                    perpendicular (at right
                    angles) to each other.

                    <li>Field Angle of Electromagnetic Wave
                        <p>In the electromagnetic waves, the angle between the electric field and magnetic field is 90
                            degree or magnetic
                            and electric fields are perpendicular to each other.</p>

                        Direction Of Electromagnetic Wave During Propagation
                        <p>The electric field and magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation</p>

                        Reflection of Electromagnetic Waves
                        <p>The Electromagnetic wave is having the characteristics of reflection just like the light
                            waves.
                            It means that
                            when electromagnetic waves strike to the surface of conducting material, they are reflected
                            back
                            as shown in the

                        <p>The electromagnetic waves also have the characteristics of reflection. It means that when the
                            electromagnetic
                            waves inters from one medium to another, it bends towards the normal or away from the normal
                            while traveling in
                            the next medium. When the electromagnetic waves inter form rare medium to dens medium, it
                            bends
                            towards the
                            normal and when the electromagnetic inter from dens to rare medium it bends away from the
                            normal.</p>

                        <h2>Intensity of Electromagnetic Waves</h2>
                        <p>The intensity of electromagnetic waves depends on the electrical field strength of the wave.
                            It
                            means that if the
                            field strength of electromagnetic waves is more, its intensity will be more and vice
                            versa.<br />The electrical
                            field strength is measured in V/m volt per meter. For the microwave it's measured in micro
                            volt
                            per meter µv/m.

                        <h2>Attenuation of Electromagnetic Waves</h2>
                        <p>When the electromagnetic wave is propagated its energy is wasted while travelling from source
                            to
                            load. This loss
                            of energy is known as attenuation of the electromagnetic waves. The attenuation occurs due
                            to
                            buildings, tree's,
                            hills, rivers etc. which observe the electromagnetic energy during propagation.</p>

                                <p>If the position of the electric field is vertical with respect to ground during
                                    propagation, it is called
                                    vertical polarization of electromagnetic waves.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Horizontal Polarization</h3>
                                <p>If the position of the electric field is horizontal with respect to ground during
                                    propagation, it is
                                    called horizontal polarization of the electromagnetic waves.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Linear polarization</h3>
                                <p>If the position of electric field is sometimes vertical and sometimes horizontal with
                                    equal intervals and
                                    the direction of propagation does not change, it is called linear polarization.</p>
