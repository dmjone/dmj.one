# Security Policy
At our educational initiative on GitHub, we take security very seriously. We understand that security is a critical aspect of any online platform, and we are committed to protecting our users' data and ensuring the privacy of their information.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability in our repository, please let us know as soon as possible by emailing us at security@dmj.one. We appreciate your help in identifying and addressing any potential security threats.

## When reporting a security issue, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

* A description of the issue and how it can be reproduced
* The version of our software that you are using
* Any steps you have taken to try to mitigate the issue
* We will work to verify and address the issue as soon as possible, and we will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

## Our Commitment to Security
We take a number of steps to ensure the security of our repository and protect our users' data, including:

* Regularly updating our software to address any known security vulnerabilities
* Using secure coding practices to minimize the risk of security flaws in our software
* Restricting access to sensitive data and only allowing authorized personnel to view or modify it
* Regularly backing up our data to prevent data loss in the event of a security breach or other issue

While we take these and other steps to ensure the security of our repository, we also rely on our users to take appropriate measures to protect their own data. We recommend that users:

* Use strong, unique passwords and never reuse passwords across multiple accounts
* Enable two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to their account
* Keep their software up-to-date to ensure they have the latest security patches and fixes

By working together, we can help ensure that our educational initiative on GitHub remains a safe and secure platform for students to access and engage with high-quality educational content in Computer Science and Engineering.
